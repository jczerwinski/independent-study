# Rationale for the course

Information systems are often theorized to have played a pivotal role in the growth of business over the course of the information revolution. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), however, has been slower to embrace this change, especially when it comes to governance.

This course explores themes around the intersection of information systems and NGO governance. Questions explored include:

- What does the NGO governance information system ecosystem look like?
- What challenges exist to the adoption of governance information systems?
- What opportunities exist for NGOs to improve upon their governance information systems?
- What might improved NGO governance information systems look like?

# Learning objectives

At the end of the course, a successful student will be able to:

- Describe the stakeholders of NGO governance information systems, and their interests.
- Describe the functions that NGO governance information systems attempt to fulfil.
- Describe the unique challenges NGO governance information systems face.
- Describe the historical use of NGO governance information systems, and the strengths and weaknesses of these systems.
- Identify opportunities for improvement in NGO governance information systems.
