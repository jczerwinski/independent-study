As per the [Independent Study syllabus](http://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/comp/comp692_3.php).

## Overview

Students and academics spend a considerable amount of time writing papers. A significant amount of this time is wasted on visual styling and formatting. Academics are subject matter experts, and not, as a rule, designers. As such, this time would be better spent developing content.

Furthermore, many tools used by academics to author scholarly documents tightly couple content and presentation -- this is a design anti-pattern. Academics also spend a significant amount of time on citation management. These problems have given rise to a large ecosystem of tools that seek to solve them.

This course explores the use of academic writing tools. Lines of inquiry include:

- What is the state of the academic writing tool ecosystem?
- What challenges exist to the adoption of academic writing tools?
- What opportunities exist for academic writing tools to improve?
- What might improved academic writing tools look like?

## Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, a successful student will be able to:

- Critically analyze and evaluate academic writing and citation management tools.
- Analyze and evaluate the requirements of academic writing and citation management tool users.
- Design and develop academic writing and citation management tools.
