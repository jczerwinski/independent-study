As per the [Independent Study syllabus](http://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/comp/comp692_3.php).

## Overview

Students and academics spend considerable time writing. Much of this time is wasted on visual styling. Academics are subject matter experts, and not, as a rule, designers. As such, this time would be better spent developing content. Furthermore, many tools used by academics to author scholarly documents tightly couple content and presentation -- this is a design anti-pattern. Academics also spend a significant amount of time on citation management. These problems have given rise to a large ecosystem of tools that seek to solve them.

This course explores the use of academic writing tools. Lines of inquiry include:

- What is the state of the academic writing tool ecosystem?
- What challenges exist to the adoption of academic writing tools?
- What opportunities exist for academic writing tools to improve?
- What might improved academic writing tools look like?

## Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, a successful student will be able to:

- Critically analyze and evaluate academic writing and citation management tools.
- Analyze and evaluate the requirements of academic writing and citation management tool users.
- Design and develop academic writing and citation management tools.

## Evaluation

This course will include three assignments:

1. [Design](assignment-1.md): A design of a academic writing system. (50% of final grade)
2. [Implementation](assignment-2.md): A system that implements the design in Assignment 1. (40% of final grade)
3. [Demonstration](assignment-3.md): A demonstration of the system developed in Assignment 2. (10% of final grade)
