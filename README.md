# Rationale for the course

Writing comprises a significant part of the work time of academics. Much of this time is spent refining presentation, and not developing content. Academics are subject matter experts, and not, as a rule, designers. As such, this time is better spent developing content. Furthermore, many of the tools and templates used by academics to author scholarly documents tightly couple content and presentation -- this is a design anti-pattern.

A significant amount of time is also spent on citation management. While a number of citation management systems exist, they often integrate poorly into the writing workflow.

While LaTeX solves many of these problems, it is highly technical and somewhat difficult to set up and use. It is also primarily designed for typesetting printed documents -- a largely obsolete requirement.

The growth in popularity of Markdown as a lightweight markup language offers a potential solution to many of these problems. It offers a simple markup syntax, decoupled content and presentation, is web-friendly, and has a healthy ecosystem of tools. Its current weakness is citation management.

This course explores themes around the use of academic writing tools. Questions explored include:

- What does the academic writing tool ecosystem look like?
- What challenges exist to the adoption of academic writing tools?
- What opportunities exist for academic writing tools to improve?
- What might improved academic writing tools look like?

# Learning objectives

At the end of the course, a successful student will be able to:

- Describe the academic writing and citation management tool ecosystem.
- Analyze and evaluate the requirements of academic writing and citation management tool users.
- Analyze and evaluate the the strengths and weaknesses of existing academic writing and citation management tools.
- Identify opportunities to improve academic writing and citation management tools. 
- Design and develop improvements to academic writing and citation management tools.
